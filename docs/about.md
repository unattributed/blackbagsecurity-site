      <h1>About</h1>

        <h3>Operating model</h3>
        <p>Senior-led delivery with direct operator involvement from scoping through retest.</p>
        <p>Experience spans 40+ years. In 1985, our founder began with computerized accounting systems running on mainframe and microcomputer platforms with telephonic connectivity, where data had to be auditable, controlled, and safeguarded. That work shaped our focus on reliable, secure software and protecting the confidentiality of users.</p>
        <p>Engagements prioritize evidence integrity, confidentiality, and realistic adversary tradecraft.</p>

        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <ul class="outcomes">
          <li>Relentless adversary focus: we design for complex attack chains, AI-assisted automation, and real-world tradecraft.</li>
          <li>Decisive execution with clear objectives, stop conditions, and escalation paths that protect uptime and safety.</li>
          <li>Evidence-first reporting: reproducible findings, measurable impact, and remediation guidance that holds under audit.</li>
          <li>Scale-ready delivery: workflow, tooling, and cadence built for high-stakes environments and rapid response.</li>
          <li>Privacy and confidentiality by default: zero disclosure, minimal collection, cryptographically protected handling, and no client data retained post-engagement.</li>
        </ul>
